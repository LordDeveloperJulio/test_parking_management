# test_parking_management

Mr. João has a parking lot and today he has a notebook where he writes down all entries and exits, 
as well as filling in which space the truck occupies each time an entry or exit occurs.

Now Mr. João wants to be able to do this in the palm of his hand with his Smartphone. With his app, 
he wants to see which spaces are or are not occupied, as well as record vehicle entries and exits 
and which space these vehicles are occupying! He also wanted to have a history of these entries and 
exits so he could close at the end of the day.

# To run the app
1. Use Flutter sdk version 3.19.0
2. Run the 'flutter pub get' command inside the 'core_network' folder and then the same command in the
   app project.
